10,play filtering and more stats under another paywall basically this ruins your value proposition because you are asking of us to pay you twice to get the whole expected functionality sorry but filtering through the data is very basic feature and you can not possibly sell it as an addons i am very unhappy that my formerly favorite stats app is treating its users like this ,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

16,two word review moneygrabbing i really wanted to rate this well after seeing the positive reviews but i simply cannot it seems everywhere you turn in the app bar for the very basics it wants yet more cash even the link to sync for the free two weeks failed not happy and unable to get a refund as i installed it yesterday and set up the games used it today and yep no sync and all those costs would have been worth it if it were a one off cost but no not as an ongoing cost which essentially drives users to their content ,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

22,great for keeping track of your games but a pain to actually add games to your collection you cannot scan a barcode so you have to search manually not too bad unless you have a game with multiple editions and boxes you have to search then add then go back to the main screen click on add again search again then add the next expansion adding homicide to this took way too long a far better streamlined add option is sorely needed ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

26,i really like the ui of the game but i have stopped using it after a few days because i really miss the itemid score lists for games such as wingspan and everdell that scorepal offers and that one is free much worse ui though any chance bg stats will add this feature any time soon ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

31,needs improvement but the best one currently available the handling of coop games is really clumsy and needs to improve basic entry of information takes way more time than it should due to poor interface design adding a game can be confusing it should just default to a big lookup instead of trying to walk me thru adding a game to the database ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
32,for the last year i have been using bored gamer tools to record stats but now that is disappeared this seems the next best option gt had a better ui provided more information and was free but this is fine this app is easy to use and most of the info you need is there so yeah its worth the money ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

37,its a cool app but missing some features you should be able to add custom toggle or fields on each game for games with different scenarios and variations this is necessary you really cannot properly track a game engine like mage knight without more granularity also the game wide score settings need to be toggleable play by play again games with different scoring variations are impossible to track with this id also like if it had a feature to back up my own database via drugbox ,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
39,good app i would like expansions to be a subcategory under the base game ie in setup checkboxes to show what expansions you are using and similar checkboxes to show the specific games setup ie what cards you are using in dominion overall i think its a great game tracker though it just takes a while entering info in by hand every time you play ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

49,love this app and love recording all our plays on it though some things i certainly wish were better as a data june by trade the dashboarding and general visualization options are both mediocre and do things in such a way that i reckon the developers are not data experts case in point its got pie plots folks pie plots and bar plots and a couple rough timeseries plots that do not add anything that is about it however i still love it the integration with big is especially lovely ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
50,really fun solid app sometimes the navigation is not the most intuitive heat map can not be viewed in portrait the process of updating expansionsselecting them is kind of a pain so i just do not do it would love to see more advanced metrics added to the insights dlc also i feel this is completely missing a way to rank games in your collection ,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

52,its a good app with some flaws id give it a if i could sync with friends and anytime we play a game together one of us added it and wed all get the option to add it or it would auto add and i could delete if i wanted one of the thanks i saw you can send the plays which is great just wish it was a tad easier 馃榾 love the app otherwise though ,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0

61,this app is great the only reason i gave it stars was that i could not figure out a good way to sync my plays of rpg such as dd and dungeon world from big i tried to import my plays of dungeon world but it thought i had been playing some game called org from i decided to just make my own placeholder for my rpg in the app instead kind of annoying because i want to record play sessions in the same app that i use for board games ,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

67,clear and enjoyable way to record game plays big integration is smooth and easy to use and the charts are fun my only fault is that there is no way to record a solo beat your own score style game without registering it as a win loss or clicking ignore for statistics which is not ideal if you are into this kind of game ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
68,prefer scanning barcode to add games rather than manually adding them ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

71,great app needs a way to determine a winner via tie breaker though ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
72,a brilliant way to see trends and patterns in your board game plays everything from how frequently you play games to win percentages to average game lengths and much more a musthave for the modern board game collector who is also interested in stats the app misses out on stars from me only because i would love to see support for expansions having them integrated rather than being considered to be separate games ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
73,great app sync well with big interesting stats shown one thing that would make it better is being able to mark the games as owned or not owned the list of games fills up with every game you have played and there is no way to see only the ones in your collection or select only the ones you own for the challenges add on to be honest this is quite a big downside as i use it to track challenges and decide what to play out of games that have not had much table time recently ,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
74,nearly perfect app makes recording plays a breeze and the sync with big is top notch the only thing that could be improved is the ability to filter plays for viewing stats for instance id like to be able to filter plays based on expansions or variants to see how scores vary between expansion combinations still well worth the price ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
75,great stat keeper for board game nerds i just wish it had a way to specify a couple of things games you personally own vs those of someone else adding expansions under the core game vs having them listed as games themselves it would be really helpful expansion wise then if they were disable under the game as clickable options as used during said gameplay otherwise i absolutely love the app it is really nice for keeping score and making challenges for yourself ,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
76,great app i would like to see player count added to the game info and the ability to sort games by player count also would like to see the ability to identify games in my list as games owned so i can log games that i have played but do not own and be able to sort between the two ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
77,good app very useful but lack some features like export all games from a specific player this would attract a lot of new users ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

82,this app is almost perfect if allowed for sub section for expansions rather than expansions as separate games i would have given five stars ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
83,the app is good at what it is set out to do but the lacking of a game collection management toll makes it not so useful to me ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
84,this app does a good job of tracking and displaying game plays and scores the ui takes some getting used to especially the icons which are difficult to understand the process for sharing plays is more work than each person just entering the information separately so in summary it good at its primary task but board game stats definitely has some issues edit they got a star back for the prompt response and letting us know how to fix the big issue ,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
85,love the app currently have plays logged really interesting to see the stats one really great feature that others have suggested would to link expansions to the base game played for instance with carcassonne if we played with the crop circles and traders and builders that could be logged that way the base game and each expansion would have logged plays thank you ,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
86,functions well the addons are worth the price only thing i wish they had was a way to attach expansions to your entries so i could track how often i use certain expansions ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

88,a very comprehensive method of tracking and viewing stats i especially like the add ons for both in depth stat viewing and tracking of personal challenges my only complaint is that the app lacks a simple way of singing plays from big navigating multiple menus to achieve this seems to be overly complex when a simple drag down from the plays screen could achieve the same thing ,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

92,very useful but there is a few more stats id like it to be able to crunch who wins most on thursday who is most likely to win when a new player filter people who have played games at least ten times thankful they are still updating it ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
93,great for stats and tracking scores over time could be more intuitive with the name scoring and rounds but its still the best game tracker i have found ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
94,maybe something to compare scores between players ,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

96,fun way to keep track of high scores ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
97,very handy for tracking stats also was nice since i just used google rewards credit to buy it knocking one star off for two reasons hard to track when you use expansions and it would be nice to set up default teams and neutral players an example is ultimate werewolf where one player is the neutral moderator and there is almost always a werewolf team and villagers team it would be nice to be able to set up the game where it always has a default team called werewolves and villagers it would also be nice that when you added a new game from the played screen it would save the team names ,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
98,prior to this app i just the boardgamegeek app and in many ways i still prefer it to actually track my games the data collection and informational graphics is what i have wanted on android for the longest time and for me that alone is worth the price but i have grown accustomed to many features of the big app that this does not provide after selecting you location id like select players list to prefer players who have played in that location provide a color optionswatches for the role selection remember what type of roles have been used in past plays in a drop down list instead of having to type them in each game provide a live timer to record how much game time has elapsed this may be just my phone but the comments section does not have autocorrect ,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
99,this app is perfect to fill that area of my life that wants to have the best and most update stats that said i have several incomplete games that are logged for my play stats that i wish did not count so i could give it a if that feature exists ,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
100,overall its very good improvement wish list make it easier to associate photos with players currently it just takes a photo wholesale cannot crop and i have to search for it maybe if it could import from google contacts make it possible to record multiple wins of a game with one session eg i might play several rounds of star realms but to record the wins accurately i have to submit each on of them as separate session ,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

102,loved this app on ios and i have been writing down every game i have played and logging it on my old phone since i switched to my new android phone as soon as the android version came out i download it however i cannot import my export from ios over to the android app i can see it in my downloads and on my google drive but the app will not allow me to open it this is really frustrating as i thought i would just be able to import all the data across i still love the app and i understand this version is still very new any help on how i can get my old data across from ios to android would be appreciated as its quite frustrating to not be able to import it thanks ,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0

108,fantastic organizational and statistical tool for all the type a boardgames put there challenges are a great way to family your gaming small feature request though can we get the icon to work with android material guidelines this app sits on my home screen but it does not match the color scheme of everything else its a small grape but at this point there is nothing else to really complain about with this app ,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0

652,full disclosure the developer of this app is a friend of mine i have been betatesting this app for a while and it is the first mpp client that i have actually found myself using quite a bit its built with a clean design and is packed with obscurebutuseful features i especially appreciate the nice balance of customizability and simplicity where other clients tend to err on the side of too many options this results in a really streamlined well throughout user experience one can tell that a great deal of attention is played to ux design another thing that makes this client really stick out is the support for various eps which really noticeably improve mobility performance keep in mind that this is a somewhat early version of the app so occasionally i still run into bugs but these are usually fixed very quickly by the developer ,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0
